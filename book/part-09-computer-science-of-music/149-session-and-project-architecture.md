# Chapter 149 — Session and Project Architecture

![Chapter 149](../../images/chapters/149.png)

A session owns a tempo map, tracks, regions, plugins, automation, routing graph, and metadata. Durable IDs connect objects across save/load; references need validation; ownership determines lifecycle. The Part IV session model is the musical view, while this chapter exposes its software boundaries.

## Try it

Run `python examples/part_09_engine.py`; inspect `src/tech_music/engine.py` and the corresponding tests. Treat all callback timing as simulation.

## Debugging question

Which boundary owns the failing state, what timestamp or ID proves it, and does the evidence show a wrong value or a late value?
