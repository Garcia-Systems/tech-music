# Chapter 129 — Why Real-Time Audio Is Different

![Chapter 129](../../images/chapters/129.png)

The audio path should avoid **unpredictable work**. Blocking disk/network I/O, contended locks, unbounded loops, verbose logging, and allocation or garbage-collection pauses can have runtime-dependent costs. This is not a universal ban: language, allocator, API, and implementation matter. Move uncertain work off the deadline path, preallocate where appropriate, and measure worst cases.

JACK's process-thread documentation is a concrete platform example, not a rule describing every runtime.

## Try it

Run `python examples/part_09_engine.py`; inspect `src/tech_music/engine.py` and the corresponding tests. Treat all callback timing as simulation.

## Debugging question

Which boundary owns the failing state, what timestamp or ID proves it, and does the evidence show a wrong value or a late value?
