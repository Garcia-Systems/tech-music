# Chapter 159 — Debugging the Audio Engine

![Chapter 159](../../images/chapters/159.png)

Use the same chain for every case: **Symptom → Evidence → Hypotheses → Investigation → Root Cause → Fix → Verification**. Silence: inspect path-to-master. Glitches: block timing. Stuck note: note lifecycle. Jitter: intra-block offsets. Invalid state: ownership/messages. Missing audio: file IDs and stream logs. Broken restore: schema and stable IDs.

Change one cause at a time and verify both samples and diagnostics.

## Try it

Run `python examples/part_09_engine.py`; inspect `src/tech_music/engine.py` and the corresponding tests. Treat all callback timing as simulation.

## Debugging question

Which boundary owns the failing state, what timestamp or ID proves it, and does the evidence show a wrong value or a late value?
