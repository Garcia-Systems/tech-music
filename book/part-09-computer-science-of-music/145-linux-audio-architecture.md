# Chapter 145 — Linux Audio Architecture

![Chapter 145](../../images/chapters/145.png)

One possible Linux path is application → JACK-compatible or PipeWire API/server → ALSA kernel/userspace interface → driver → device. Applications may also use ALSA directly, and deployments vary. PipeWire documentation accessed 2026-08-21 describes a graph-based multimedia service; JACK and ALSA remain distinct projects and interfaces.

## Try it

Run `python examples/part_09_engine.py`; inspect `src/tech_music/engine.py` and the corresponding tests. Treat all callback timing as simulation.

## Debugging question

Which boundary owns the failing state, what timestamp or ID proves it, and does the evidence show a wrong value or a late value?
