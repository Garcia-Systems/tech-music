# Chapter 133 — Event Queues and Scheduling

![Chapter 133](../../images/chapters/133.png)

Events carry sparse intent; audio buffers carry dense samples. A queue orders timestamps and exposes events due within a scheduling horizon. For a block `[1000,1256)`, an event at 1120 belongs at offset 120—not at 1000 or 1256. Half-open ranges prevent processing boundary events twice.

The lab renders correct intra-buffer timing and deliberately snapped timing for comparison.

## Try it

Run `python examples/part_09_engine.py`; inspect `src/tech_music/engine.py` and the corresponding tests. Treat all callback timing as simulation.

## Debugging question

Which boundary owns the failing state, what timestamp or ID proves it, and does the evidence show a wrong value or a late value?
