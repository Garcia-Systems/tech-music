# Chapter 141 — Plugin Architecture

![Chapter 141](../../images/chapters/141.png)

A host discovers a plugin, negotiates an interface, creates/activates it, supplies audio and events, manages parameters/state/UI, then deactivates and destroys it. LV2, VST 3, Audio Unit, and CLAP illustrate different contracts; they are examples, not interchangeable wrappers. Versioned official specifications are the authority.

## Try it

Run `python examples/part_09_engine.py`; inspect `src/tech_music/engine.py` and the corresponding tests. Treat all callback timing as simulation.

## Debugging question

Which boundary owns the failing state, what timestamp or ID proves it, and does the evidence show a wrong value or a late value?
