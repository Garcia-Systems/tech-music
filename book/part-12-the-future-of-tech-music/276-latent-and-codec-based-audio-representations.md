# Chapter 276 — Latent and Codec-Based Audio Representations

## Model

An encoder can map audio to a compact continuous latent or discrete codec tokens; a generator operates there; a decoder reconstructs audio. Compression reduces sequence or compute demands but introduces a representation ceiling and reconstruction artifacts. This extends Part VI’s lesson that representation choices shape possible operations.

## Engineering questions

- What inputs, state, parameters, and versions determine the result?
- Which decision is fixed, sampled, learned, or left to a person?
- What invariant can software test, and what judgment requires a listener?
- What failure evidence and recovery control should the interface expose?

## Connection to the book

Parts II and VIII supply musical/event vocabulary; Parts V–VII render and process sound; Parts IX–XI supply scheduling, persistence, validation, and hardware boundaries.
